# Technical Design & Architecture

## Engine
Unity (2D)

## Physics System
Custom deterministic pseudophysics:
- Manual velocity integration
- Gravity modifier
- Drag coefficient
- Hard caps for all values

No Rigidbody2D usage in core loop.

## Performance Strategy
- Object pooling for all flight elements
- No per-frame allocations
- FixedUpdate avoided where possible

## Camera
- Static camera in MVP
- Overlay UI for minimap and indicators

## Input
- Designed controller-first
- Keyboard/mouse supported
- Abstracted input layer for future platforms

## Multiplayer Readiness
- Deterministic systems
- No reliance on physics engine randomness
- Turn-based and hotseat friendly architecture
