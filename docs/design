# Game Design Document — Core Systems

## Player Agency
Primary interactions:
- Decision-making during flight (skill usage)
- Resource management
- Pre-launch setup optimization

## Heroes
MVP:
- 1 hero (scalable to 4)
- Stats-based differentiation

Hero Properties:
- Force
- Weight
- Intelligence
- Skill Charges

Hero Abilities:
- 2 Active Skills
- 1 Passive Skill
- Skills may use:
  - Cooldowns
  - Per-flight limits
  - Hybrid systems

## Intelligence Stat
Affects:
- Timing window forgiveness
- Angle tolerance during launch

## Launchers
- 3 launchers + 1 launched hero (future scaling)
- Launcher passives influence:
  - Launch force
  - Modifiers

## Launch Input
Hybrid system:
- Angle selection
- Power modifiers
- Timing click
- Modulated by hero stats and items

## Flight Phase
- Side-scroll style
- Active skills usable
- Resource recovery possible mid-flight
- Camera remains stable (no dynamic tracking in MVP)

## Flight System (Core Gameplay)

### Flight Overview
The game uses a 2D side-scrolling flight system inspired by arcade launch games (e.g. Burrito Bison / Turtle Toss).

The hero is launched once per attempt and travels from left to right across the screen.

### Axes & Movement
- X-axis: forward progression (left → right)
- Y-axis: vertical movement (gravity-based)

The player does NOT directly control position during flight.
There is no manual steering on X or Y axes.

### Physics Model
- Deterministic pseudophysics (custom system)
- No Rigidbody or real physics simulation
- Movement is calculated via:
  - Initial launch impulse
  - Gravity modifier
  - Drag / decay
  - Hard caps on speed, height, and flight duration

### Launcher Definition
The launcher is a conceptual slingshot / catapult system:
- It provides a single, initial impulse at launch
- It does not apply force after launch
- Launcher properties modify:
  - Initial force
  - Launch angle tolerance
  - Additional modifiers via passives

Launchers are NOT physical objects in the scene.
They are a logical system affecting initial flight parameters.

### Player Interaction During Flight
Player interaction is limited to:
- Activating skills
- Managing resources
- Reacting to obstacles and modifiers

The player cannot:
- Steer the hero freely
- Adjust trajectory directly after launch

### Camera
- Dynamic follow or zoom
- Flight occurs within a fixed viewport

Future versions may introduce camera dynamics, but MVP assumes a stable frame.

## Board Map
- 40 tiles per map
- Fog of War applies to tile effects, not distance
- Overlay minimap visible during flight

Tile Types:
- Neutral
- Event (one-time)
- Modifier (run-altering)
- Vendor
- Checkpoint

## Economy
- Currency earned per flight/run
- Vendors appear only on tiles
- Items are unidentified until purchased
- One backpack slot per hero

## Bosses (Post-MVP Concept)
Bosses are system challenges, not enemies:
- Economy stress tests
- Skill restriction runs
- Launcher debuff challenges

## MVP Scope
Included:
- 1 map
- 1 hero
- Basic launch loop
- Neutral tiles
- Vendor with basic items

Excluded:
- Lore
- Bosses
- Multiplayer
