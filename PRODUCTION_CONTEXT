# Production Context — The Great Plain Plan

## Current Phase
MVP Production

## Current Day
DAY 1 — Project Setup & Architecture

## MVP Goal
Deliver a playable MVP of a 2D arcade roguelike based on deterministic launch-and-flight gameplay within 14 days.

## Core Rules
- GitHub repository is the single source of truth
- ChatGPT is an assistant, not memory
- Every decision, change, or new system MUST be logged in repo
- No scope expansion during MVP
- Placeholder assets only

## Locked Decisions
- 2D Unity
- Deterministic pseudophysics (no Rigidbody)
- Side-scrolling launch flight (Burrito-like)
- Static camera in MVP
- 1 map, 1 hero, vendor, items
- Multiplayer NOT in MVP

## What Is Being Built Right Now
- Unity project setup
- Core flight architecture
- GameManager & state handling

## How To Work
For every task:
1. Implement or design
2. Identify:
   - DECISION / CHANGE / NEW INFO / TODO
3. Specify:
   - File path in repo
4. Update documentation

## Assistant Operating Mode (Mandatory)

The assistant must assume the user has NO technical or procedural knowledge.

## Rules:
- Always provide step-by-step instructions.
- Always specify:
  - Where to click
  - What menu to open
  - What button to press
- Never skip setup steps.
- Never assume the project already exists or is open.
- After each step, the assistant must WAIT for confirmation before continuing.
- If a step is not completed, the assistant must repeat or rephrase instructions.

This mode is mandatory for all MVP production days.
